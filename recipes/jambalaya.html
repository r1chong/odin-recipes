        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables. With French and Spanish influences, jambalaya is quite similar to paella. The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Provençal word "jambalaia," which means mishmash.</p>
        <p>Like many Cajun and Creole foods, jambalaya starts with the Cajun holy trinity: a flavor base of onion, bell peppers, and celery.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>10 ounces andouille sausage, sliced into rounds</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 small green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can crushed Italian tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon file powder</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of peanut oil in a large heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. Season the sausage and chicken pieces with Cajun seasoning. Sauté sausage until browned. Remove with slotted spoon, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil, and sauté chicken pieces until lightly browned on all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, saute onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic until tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, and season with red pepper, black pepper, salt, hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and filé powder.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and sausage. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
